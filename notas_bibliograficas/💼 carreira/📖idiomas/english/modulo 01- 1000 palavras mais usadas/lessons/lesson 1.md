When I was young, I sent my mother a very beautiful dress from Spain. She loved it. It was a long white dress with a ruffle and a peach print. It was very simple, but she truly loved it, or at least she tried  hard not to show if she didn't like it.

### Text with 350 Words Using the Word peach

When I was a child, summers always felt magical, and nothing symbolized that time of year more than the sweet taste of a peach. My grandparents had a small fruit garden behind their house, and the peach trees were always my favorite. Their delicate pink blossoms(flores) in the spring turned into fuzzy(virar a fruta), golden fruits by mid-summer. I would spend hours sitting under those trees, watching the sunlight filter through the leaves, waiting for the perfect moment to pick the ripest peach(pessêgo mais maduro).

One summer, my grandfather decided to teach me how to care for the trees. He explained how pruning(podar) the branches and watering the roots(raiz) properly(propriamente) would ensure(garantir) a better harvest(colheita). I wasn’t sure I fully understood at the time, but I loved spending those quiet mornings with him. When the peaches were finally ready to be picked, my grandmother would gather us in the kitchen to bake(assar) peach pies and make jars of peach jam. The smell of sugar, cinnamon(canela), and peaches would fill the house, creating a sense of comfort I’ve never forgotten.

Years later, when I moved to the city for work, I often missed the simplicity of those summer days. One weekend, while shopping at a farmer’s market, I came across a stand selling fresh peaches. The vendor let me sample one, and as soon as I tasted the sweet, juicy fruit, I was transported back to those sunny afternoons in my grandparents’ orchard(pomar). Inspired, I bought an entire basket and decided to try making peach jam on my own.

Though my jam didn’t turn out quite as good as my grandmother’s, the process brought back memories of my childhood and the importance of slowing down to savor life’s simple pleasures(prazeres). To me, a peach is more than just a fruit—it’s a reminder of family, love, and the beauty of life’s little moments.
