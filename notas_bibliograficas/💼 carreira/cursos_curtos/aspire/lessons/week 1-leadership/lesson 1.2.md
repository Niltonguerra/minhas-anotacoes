Question for You: What was your most positive experience with a leader? What was your least positive experience with a leader?
answer: My most positive experience as a leader was when I successfully suggested that my college — which handled sensitive data — switch from using HTTP to HTTPS, improving the security of its communications. On the other hand, my worst experience as a leader happened when I proposed a market analysis project idea at the company I was working for. Unfortunately, the initiative got out of hand and went wrong in almost every possible way.
