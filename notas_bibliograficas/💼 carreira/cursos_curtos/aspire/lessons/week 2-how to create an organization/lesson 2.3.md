In your own words, explain the issue Dr. Shetty was hoping to solve and summarize how he tackled the institutional voids he faced.
Answer:From what I understand, Dr. Shetty aimed to provide access to healthcare for people in less favorable financial situations. To achieve this goal, he sought investments to build a hospital focused on treating illnesses. Additionally, he adopted telemedicine as a strategy to reduce healthcare costs and thereby expand access to medical services for low-income populations.
